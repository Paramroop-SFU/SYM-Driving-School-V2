        <p class="paragraph">The owner of SYM Driving School started established this driving school more than 12 years ago. He was an experienced truck driver 
            who has decades of experience driving different types of vehicles. The owner and many of his friends are all experienced drivers, so he decided to 
            start up a driving school with his friends.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">All the coaches at SYM Driving School are class 1 drivers with 30+ years of driving experience and have taught at SYM Driving School for 
            over a decade.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">Coaches at SYM Driving School had helped over thousands of students pass their class 5/7 road test with flying colours
            in their decade of service.
