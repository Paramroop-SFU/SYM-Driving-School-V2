# Focus Driving School
**Group Abilities**
  
Our group’s abilities range from previous experience with basic web development to no experience with web development, and at most minimal experience with APIs. Because of this, we are all willing and eager to learn the skills necessary to complete the project.

**Solving the Problem**
  
When meeting with the client, they requested a website to advertise their driving school and manage their lesson bookings. We were given the creative freedom to design the rest of the website. The client’s problem was lacking advertisement for their driving school and having to keep track of bookings by hand. We plan to solve this problem by providing a website with a front page, a form for new students to book a lesson, and a login dashboard for the owner and instructors to log their lesson schedules and manage student data. This will make managing bookings easier for the instructors and booking an initial lesson more convenient for students. It also makes communication between the owner and instructors more efficient. Having a website will also allow the school to reach a bigger audience by advertising outside of just word of mouth, and provide convenience to new students when booking their initial lesson. 

**Features**

The website will include a front page with language options for English or Chinese which has information about the school, a reviews page which displays reviews of the school taken from Google (with Google Business Profiles API), and a form for prospective students to book an initial lesson. This form will ask the student for availability, contact information, and will ask them to drop a pin on a map to show their general location (with the help of Google Maps API). There will also be a login feature for the company owner and the driving instructors. The login will lead to a dashboard with a schedule (with Hapio API) that displays lessons. The owner can view the forms submitted by new students and schedule initial lessons with instructors. The instructors can view and change their own lessons. Instructors can communicate with the owner through the dashboard chat (with Weavy Chap API). There will also be an email reminder system that sends reminder emails to students about upcoming lessons. 

Our website will serve as an advertising page, a sign-up area for new students, and a lesson management system for instructors. Having all these aspects of the driving school in one website offers a huge advantage to both students and instructors as everything is managed in one place, which is what sets our website apart from other driving school websites.

**User Experience Stories**

A student in need of driving lessons can find the driving school website, read the information in the front page and may decide to book an initial lesson. They open the form, put their information in, and then send it. They get an email later from the system saying they have been scheduled for a lesson. 
The owner can log into their dashboard and see that a new student has submitted a lesson form. They can review the student’s information and their location, and assign an instructor to that student. The owner would book a lesson for that instructor and maybe send them a message in the chat about the student.

An instructor can log into their dashboard through the website and view the lessons they have that week. They may see that the owner has scheduled a lesson with a new student for them. The instructor can view the student’s information and choose to contact them if needed.

**Scope**
  
The epics for this project are the reviews for the school, the student form which involves location as an input, the email reminders for the students and instructors, the dashboard with a calendar view of the schedule for instructors and the owner to manage bookings, and a chat area for instructors and the owner to communicate. All these aspects will make managing bookings easy and convenient for instructors.
